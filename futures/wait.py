"""
We can control the behavior of the wait function by defining when it should return. We can pass one of these values to the return_when param of the function: FIRST_COMPLETED, FIRST_EXCEPTION and ALL_COMPLETED. By default, itâ€™s set to ALL_COMPLETED, so the wait function returns only when all futures complete. But using that parameter, we can choose to return when the first future completes or first exception encounters.
